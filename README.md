Catch the "Click me" button 20 times to reveal your reward! The button moves around and runs away from your cursor, sometimes disappearing and reappearing elsewhere. Good luck catching it!

2. It will run away from you—chase it and click when you catch it!
3. Sometimes it disappears and reappears in a new spot
4. Get 20 clicks to reveal the link: [Cupid Quest](https://xal3xand3r.github.io/cupid-quest/)
